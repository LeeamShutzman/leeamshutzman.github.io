                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                <p>
                    From time to time I do some work for my mother's companies, and I have to log my hours. I wanted
                    to automate both the recording of the hours as well as the calculation my compensation, so I created
                    a full stack project that consists of a mobile app for recording
                    the hours, a website to view the hours worked by month and year, a Microsoft SQL Server relational
                    database to store the data, and a Node.js server to run the website.
                </p>
                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <p>
                    A Node.js server is running on my PC and is using Express to listen for get requests on port 5000. I
                    configured my router to route requests on this port to my
                    PC's local IP. Once a request is recieved, the Node server connects to the Microsoft SQL Server also
                    running on my PC and sends an SQL statement based on the
                    URL parameters. Once the Node app has recieved the data and processed it, the app uses EJS to render
                    an HTML webpage to send to the user.<br> <br>

                    When the user first visits the home page, they are prompted to enter their name into the text box
                    and upon pressing enter, the page gets populated with the
                    data that was sent from the SQL server. The year is also a part of the SQL statement which is by
                    default set to the current year. The user can navigate between
                    years with the left and right buttons. Below the name text field there is a grid of "month" buttons
                    that display their respective month's hours worked. Clicking
                    one of these buttons leads to another webpage that has a more detailed account of the hours worked
                    that month and the break down of the earnings. At the bottom of
                    the home page it shows the total amount of hours worked for the year and the total income for the
                    year.
