                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                <p>
                    At my first job, I used Java and Springboot to develop APIs. After 2 years working there, I switched companies as well as tech stacks, but
                    I still enjoyed working in Springboot and Java. In order to keep my skills sharp, I wanted to work on a Springboot project, but one that I 
                    would actually use. I decided to make a todo list app mostly because I wanted one with a custom design, but also because the functionality 
                    is simple, and it would allow me to focus on adhering to best practices as well as to learn about everything that goes into building a 
                    project from the ground up like cloud hosting, security, scalability, and more.
                </p>
                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <p>
                    The backend REST API is written in Java using Springboot using a Microservices layered architecture. The API is hosted in Docker containers
                    on an EC2 instance on AWS. The API communicates with an RDS Postgres database that stores user and task data. The database is also hosted on 
                    AWS and is only accessible by the EC2 instance that's in the same private subnet. The frontend is written in React Native so that there is one 
                    codebase for web, iOS, and Android. The frontend is also hosted on the EC2 instance and has SSL security with a publically available DNS domain
                    at: <a class="URL" href="https://bandwidth.ddns.net/">https://bandwidth.ddns.net/</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the user creates an account and logs in, their password is encrypted in transit and hashed when stored in the database. There is a user table 
                    and a task table. The the relationship in the database is one user can have many tasks. Users can be created and updated from the front end, but to 
                    fully delete your accout you have to contact an administrator. Tasks can be created, updated, deleted, and marked as complete. Tasks have color coded 
                    priority levels that can be modified at any time.
